# Reading Materials API

This is the backend for the **Reading Materials App**, a full-stack project built as part of our Unit 4 Collaboration Project.

The API allows users to:
- Create, read, update, and delete reading materials (books, magazines, mangas)
- Create and view reviews associated with each reading material
- Fetch reading materials along with all related reviews nested inside the response

## Full CRUD Functionality

This API fully supports Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) operations for both ReadingMaterials and Reviews.  
Users can:
- Create new reading materials and reviews
- Retrieve lists or specific entries
- Update existing records
- Delete records if needed

All endpoints follow RESTful design principles for easy frontend integration.


## Technologies Used

- Python
- Django
- Django REST Framework
- PostgreSQL (for production database, SQLite used for development)
- Git / GitHub for version control

## Setting Up the Python Environment

To ensure that everyone is working with the correct Python dependencies, we have included a Python virtual environment in this repository, named `python-env`. You can either activate the existing environment or create a new one based on the `requirements.txt`.

### Option 1: Activating the Existing `python-env` Environment

If you already have the `python-env` directory in the project, follow these steps to activate it:

#### On macOS/Linux:
1. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd path/to/your/project
    ```
2. Activate the environment:
    ```bash
    source python-env/bin/activate
    ```

#### On Windows:
1. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd path\to\your\project
    ```
2. Activate the environment:
    ```bash
    .\python-env\Scripts\activate
    ```

Once the environment is activated, you can install the required dependencies (if not already installed) by running:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Option 2: Creating a New Virtual Environment

If you prefer to create a new virtual environment, follow these steps:

#### 1. Create a New Virtual Environment:
1. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd path/to/your/project
    ```
2. Create a virtual environment (you can name it something else if you prefer):
    ```bash
    python3 -m venv python-env
    ```

#### 2. Activate the Virtual Environment:

##### On macOS/Linux:
```bash
source python-env/bin/activate
```

##### On Windows:
```bash
.\python-env\Scripts\activate
```

#### 3. Install Dependencies:
After activating the environment, install the required packages:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
