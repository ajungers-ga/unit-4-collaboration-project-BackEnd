# Reading Materials API

This is the backend for the **Reading Materials App**, a full-stack project built as part of our Unit 4 Collaboration Project.

The API allows users to:
- Create, read, update, and delete reading materials (books, magazines, mangas)
- Create and view reviews associated with each reading material
- Fetch reading materials along with all related reviews nested inside the response
